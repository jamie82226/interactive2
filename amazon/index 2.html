            <p class="highlight">Amazon has changed the way Americans shop.</p>
            <br> This year, the e-commerce giant said its annual Prime Day sale was “the biggest shopping event in Amazon history.” During the 36-hour event, people bought over 100 million products, crashed the website, and signed up for more Prime memberships than ever before. The behavior is indicative of the buying culture Amazon created. The company's ease, speed, and savings — underscored by killer perks like free, expedited shipping and simple returns — has encouraged more people to shop online, more often.

            <br>
            But these free benefits come with a 
            <br><p class="highlight">hidden environmental cost that doesn’t show up on the checkout page</p>, experts say. Expedited shipping means your packages may not be as consolidated as they could be, leading to more cars and trucks required to deliver them, and an 
            <br><p class="highlight">increase in packaging waste, </p>  which researchers have found is adding more congestion to our cities, pollutants to our air, and cardboard to our landfills.</span>

         Free and fast shipping has always been a Prime membership’s marquee perk — one that’s drawn in over 100 million subscribers who pay $119 annually. A 2017 study by UPS found that nearly all (96%) US customers had made a purchase on a marketplace like Amazon or Walmart, and over half (55%) said free or discounted shipping was the primary reason.

           Riddhi Sanghvi is one of them. She’s a Boston-based architect with so little time to run errands that she depends on Amazon Prime. “I use it for pretty much anything and everything,” she told BuzzFeed News.
           <br>
           But lately Sanghvi has become concerned about the environmental impact of her Amazon deliveries. She recently ordered a children’s book that came in a big box that could have fit much more; in another delivery from Amazon-owned Whole Foods, sparsely filled grocery bags were delivered with nonrecyclable insulation liners destined for the trash. “I’m torn,” she said. <p class="highlight">“The convenience is amazing, but the waste is a shame.” </p> </span>

            <p class= "highlight">
         That convenience is encouraging people in the US to buy more, and to make more individual purchases rather than placing a single order for several items. </p>
         “There are more sales in lower-price products online than there have been in stores,” Marshal Cohen, chief industry advisor at the NPD Group, told BuzzFeed News. And all of those transactions are negatively impacting our planet, according to Miguel Jaller, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis: “People are consuming more. There’s more demand created by the availability of these cheap products and cheap delivery options.”
            <br>
            <br>
        Experts say that e-commerce could actually, if optimized, be beneficial for the environment. Getting into your personal vehicle and going to the store isn’t very efficient, but consolidating multiple shoppers’ deliveries into one vehicle can be. Anne Goodchild, director of the University of Washington’s Supply Chain Transportation and Logistics Center, told BuzzFeed News, “Broadly speaking, delivery services have the potential to dramatically reduce miles traveled.”
           <br>
           <br>
          However, <p class="highlight">people aren’t offsetting the traffic to shopping malls and grocery stores by buying online. “The problem is we are still doing both, meaning there are more emissions and more congestion,” </p>Jaller said. In fact, the number of trucks (which includes all types, not just delivery vehicles) on the road has doubled since 1995. Amazon was founded in 1994, and the company's free two-day shipping program, Amazon Prime, first launched in 2005.</span>

          Amazon is only speeding up customers’ options. </p>
          In addition to free two-day shipping for Prime members, Amazon added free two-hour delivery with a new service, called Prime Now, in 2014, and it increasingly relies on hundreds of thousands of independent contractors with passenger cars to make those deliveries. Amazon’s Flex program, which operates in 50 US cities, is an app-based platform like Uber, but instead of dropping off people, Flex drivers drop off Prime packages or groceries.

          “Drivers are going from their home base to a warehouse to your house, and back to their home base. And warehouses are farther than the store you would have gone to,” Goodchild said.
           <br>
           <br>
          While experts agree that, when comparing miles traveled, e-commerce could be better for the planet if its logistics were optimized, the benefit is less clear when comparing emissions. “Commercial trucks are heavier and higher-polluting per mile [than passenger vehicles],” said Goodchild. 
           <p class="highlight">
            Trucks run on diesel produces four times more nitrogen dioxide pollution and 22 times more particulates than petrol.    </p>

           <br>

           It’s not just the cars and trucks — <br><p class="highlight"> rushed packages are often transported on planes, which produce a lot of CO2</p> , and Amazon is investing more (to the tune of $1 billion) in its own fleet. “In general, if something is coming from a longer distance, it will absolutely be air shipped,” said University of Washington’s Don MacKenzie, who leads the Sustainable Transportation Lab. Ground transportation, which is slower, is much more energy efficient than air travel.

         “On an item-by-item basis, whether home delivery is greener depends on how many items you buy per trip. We don’t replace one shopping trip with one online delivery. We replace it with four or five or six home deliveries,” said MacKenzie.
         <br> 
         <br>
          Consumers also take advantage of lenient return policies, which multiplies the number of vehicle miles traveled. “Many companies offer free returns, which creates more traffic and the like. If you don’t need it, don’t buy it,” Jaller said.

         The consequence of all those different orders, shipped separately and returned for free, is more cars, more trucks, more planes, and more cardboard. </p>
           <br>
           <br>
         Cities are collecting more cardboard from street curbs than ever before. “In the last year, we have delivered larger recycling bins to 70% of single-family homes in San Francisco,” said Robert Reed of Recology SF, a San Francisco–based curbside collection company. People like the larger bins, he told BuzzFeed News, because they accommodate cardboard boxes from online shopping deliveries.

            One waste management company has seen a 20% increase in cardboard over the last decade.
